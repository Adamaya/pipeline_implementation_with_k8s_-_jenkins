# pipeline_implementation_with_k8s_-_jenkins
automation is required everywhere create and test a deployment using kubernetes orchestration tool and jenkins pipeline.

## Steps:
to create it firstly we need to create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using dockerfile and that image must be configured in such a way that whenever we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container. following script is the Dockerfile sctipt to build image
 
- Dockerfile of jenkins-k8s
**Note:**- add your minikube credential

```
FROM centos
RUN yum install wget -y
RUN yum install java-11-openjdk-devel -y
RUN yum install sudo -y
RUN yum install git -y
RUN sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
RUN sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
RUN yum install jenkins -y

# for configuring kubectl
COPY kubectl /usr/bin
RUN sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/kubectl

# add your client.key, client.crt and ca.crt
COPY client.key /root
COPY client.crt /root
COPY ca.crt /root
RUN mkdir .kube
COPY .kube /root/.kube

EXPOSE 8080

```


run the following command to build the jenkins image. **you can change the image name in my case I am using 'adamayasharma/jenkins-k8s' image name

- `docker build -t adamayasharma/jenkins-k8s .`

run the docker container of build image. **I am mounting /root/devops/Task_3_perform_the_same_task2_with_k8s to container at /home because my deployment yml scripts are situateed in /root/devops/Task_3_perform_the_same_task2_with_k8s folder**. in your case mount your directory where your yml files are situated.

- `docker container run -dit -p 8085:8080 --name jenkins-k8s  -v /root/devops/Task_3_perform_the_same_task2_with_k8s:/home adamayasharma/jenkins-k8s`

open link in web address bar `<ip of VM>:8085`

to see the password of jenkins run command.

- `docker exec <name> cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

login and configure the jenkins.


### **Now we will build the jobs in jenkins**
- In Job1 we will Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github and build and push the docker image to the docker hub registry.for that you need to download and install github and docker plugins from plugins manager. after installing the plugins go to job1, click on configure and **do as given in images**.

this will download the repository from github.
![job1_1](/images/job1_1.JPG)
![job1_2](/images/job1_2.JPG)

this shell script identify the programming language of downloaded code. 
```
count=$(ls | grep .php | wc -l)
if [[ $count -gt 0 ]]
then
cp -vr * /home/php
exit 0
else
exit 1
fi
```

![job1_3](/images/job1_3.JPG)

If the programming language is php then it will build an php docker image and push it to docker hub otherwise it won't work.

![job1_4](/images/job1_4.JPG)

this shell script identify the programming language of downloaded code.
```
count=$(ls | grep .php | wc -l)
if [[ $count == 0 ]]
then
cp -vr * /home/html
exit 0
else
exit 1
fi
```

![job1_5](/images/job1_5.JPG)

If the programming language is html then it will build a httpd docker image and push it to docker hub otherwise it won't work.

![job1_6](/images/job1_6.JPG)

save it


- In Job2 looking at the code or program file, Jenkins automatically start the respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins wil start the container that has PHP already installed ) over the kubernetes. for the your kubernetes cluster must running.

for configuring the job go to job 2 , click on configure and do same as given in image.

![job1_1](/images/job2_1.JPG)

this code automatically deploy your images over the kubernetes according to the matched condition.
```
count=$(ls /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/job1_pull_repository_build_image_push_dockerhub | grep .php | wc -l)
if [[ $count -gt 0 ]]
then
  if kubectl get deployment | grep php
  then
    exit 0
  else
    kubectl create -f /home/php-deployment.yml
  fi
else
  if kubectl get deployment | grep http
  then
    exit 0
  else
    kubectl create -f /home/http-deployment.yml
  fi
fi
```

![job1_2](/images/job2_2.JPG)

save it

- In job Job3 we will Test our app if it is working or not.

![job3_1](/images/job3_1.JPG)

This script will check that the website is working or not.
```
sleep 5
status=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" 192.168.99.102:30600)
if [[ $status == 200 ]]
then
echo "web application working"
else
echo "web application is not working"
fi
```

for notifications
![job3_3](/images/job3_3.JPG)


apply and save

- In Job 4 we are gonna redeploy the webserver if it won't work.

![job4_3](/images/job3_2.JPG)
## how to test

create a build pipeline and execute the jobs in serial order.

## Common problems that may occur
- docker plugin must be configured in your jenkins cloud. If it is not check this [READMD_file](readme/README.md)
- if email notifications are not working then then use this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DULs4Wq4xMg) to configure the email service.
